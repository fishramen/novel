# novel
this project was based on the 50,000 word novel project set forth by the larger project NaNoGenMo. my particular work focuses on my own confusion and frustration when coding, which, ironically, is the means by which my entire book was created. enjoy :)



my code was taken and modified from this code by @/QuinnKybartas:
